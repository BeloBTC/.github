I were tring to find a short name that could fit in a new bitcoinization project, then I found the beloBTC an saw that the .com is available to buy, then I bought the domain and also started the organization launch. Did the logo with gemini just to start, created profile in main social networks as Facebook, X / twitter, Instagram, Nostr, Discord, Reddit, Stackoverflow and Github.

In a public space and alone I did the BeloBTC act of foundation in a random Subway.
